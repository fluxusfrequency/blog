Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of "engineer." An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity. Engineering in this sense embodies MacGyver scrappiness, a doggedness compatible with today's values of innovative disruption. But then, no reasonable person would want MacGyver building their bridges or buildings. Or software!
