Wikipedia:

Engineer
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_engineering
"One of the core issues in software engineering is that its approaches are not empirical enough because a real-world validation of approaches is usually absent, or very limited and hence software engineering is often misinterpreted as feasible only in a "theoretical environment."

Stop Calling Yourself an Engineer

http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2015/11/programmers-should-not-call-themselves-engineers/414271/
```
Engineerwashing entails a shift from the noun to the verbal sense of "engineer." An engineer is a professional who designs, builds, and maintains systems. But to engineer means skillfully, artfully, or even deviously contriving an outcome. To engineer is to jury-rig, to get something working more or less, for a time. Sufficiently enough that it serves an immediately obvious purpose, but without concern or perhaps even awareness of its longevity. Engineering in this sense embodies MacGyver scrappiness, a doggedness compatible with today's values of innovative disruption. But then, no reasonable person would want MacGyver building their bridges or buildings. Or software!

Language and Math

Code as poetry or literature
If Hemmingway Wrote JavaScript
Elements of Style / Ruby Style Guide
WordPress - Code is Poetry [ http://torquemag.io/code-poetry/, https://marketpress.com/2013/code-is-poetry/, http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/05/the-poetics-of-coding/]
Arranging symbols
Poetry opens the doors - symbols resonate with connotative meanings, and
there are many ways to describe the same thing
"Interpretation, grammatical inaccuracies or hidden meanings are exactly the opposite of what good code is made of. " (marketpress)
Conventions
Being understood - Naming is hard, commenting, the terseness spectrum
"Code has purpose and meaning. It requires structure. It should be lightweight and elegant" (smashing)

As Literature

Communication with peers
Consideration for the reader

As a Craft
Medieval guilds
Bootcamp


Changing the fabric of society

Rock Star Syndrome

Meetups
OSS Contributions
Ninja, Rock Star, etc.
Similar to social media leading us to believe that everyone else is having a better time and achieving more than we are, the extreme proliferation of new frameworks and OSS versions makes us believe that we will never catch up, and we need to spend most or all of our free hours working on learning more so that we can stay relevant. But it's an unreachable goal. [Laundry Lists](http://rmurphey.com/blog/2015/03/23/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers-2015) of things you should learn...

Why did we fall in love in the first place?
Problem solving. Creating. Making the unknown known.
