# Actually MVP

## Introduction

In the startup world, there is a lot of talk about building Minimum Viable Products (MVPs). At this point, the concept has become so well-accepted that it has almost become a kind of unquestioned dogma. Yet there is a lot of disagreement about what MVP is exactly, and how to carry it out. Many people in the software industry assume that they know what MVP means, and claim to be using the process, but their production workflow tells a different story.

When it comes to building software, it is often tempting to take an approach akin to building a skyscraper: write the blueprints, obtain the necessary prequisites, then build it to spec. But software is a quickly shifting market. A businessperson may think she knows what the market wants, and plan and begin a project to meet that desire. But by the time the product is built, the needs of consumers have often morphed in a direction that she could never have foreseen.

In this post, we'll take explore some common misconceptions about MVP, some different ways to approach building one in software, and how to best use this tool if you're the CEO or CTO of a startup, a product manager for an established company, or a consultant.

## Why MVP?

We hear a lot of talk about MVP and its value, but as a businessperson, why should you care? The reason is simple: it prevents you from spending money building a product that nobody wants.

When you build your business around successive iterations of tiny features, the time before you can reflect on lessons learned is as small as possible. It even push you to decide _not_ to build your big idea, saving you a whole failed chapter in your career.

Another great benefit of an MVP approach is that it allows you to test a hypothesis with minimal resources. If you have no money in the bank, you can still get something off the ground. Just look at [Leo Grand](http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/10/homeless-coder-prevails-over-skeptics-releases-mobile-app-to-get-off-the-streets/).

## History

In the startup world, the idea of MVP was popularized by [Steve Blank (SB)](http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507) and [Eric Reis(ER)](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/10/about-author.html). Eric's 2008 blog post, [The Lean Startup](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html), kicked off a movement in software development toward building companies around the idea of testing business hypotheses in an iterative way. The idea of MVP is central to this approach, and has become part of the _lingua franca_ of startup culture.

The origins of MVP (and lean software development) draw on the Toyota corporation's [lean manufacturing approach](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing), called the Toyota Production System (TPS). Toyota bigwig [Taiichi Ohno](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno) coined the idea of "Just In Time" production, in which return on investment is maximized by reducing inventory.

Among other things, the TPS introduced the idea of [Kanban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban). The key takeaway of TPS as it applies to software is this: ***production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer***.

## It's Not What You Think It Is

We've all seen this picture right?

Raise your hand if you think it's a good idea. Now raise your hand if you think you actually follow it. Really? Are you sure you didn't motorize your skateboard? Put a steering wheel on your bike? Let me ask you this: did you actually do a customer interview at any point to see if they even _wanted_ a car?

An MVP may not be what you think it is. Eric Reis [defines it](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html) as "that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort". What does that actually mean?

It means building just enough of a product to be deployed and used. It's the _minimum_ feature set that you need to find out whether it makes sense to invest further in an idea. If you're building a dating site for dogs, what do you need? Profiles and messaging. You don't need favoriting, automated emails, or the ability to see who viewed your profile.

If you're breaking ground with a new idea, you can ask yourself: would people use this?
If you're spinning something that's already out there, ask: would people love this more than what they're using now?

Then answer that question. Build profiles and messaging, put it in front of some users, and see if they love it. Track clicks, invite them in for an interview, get their email and reach out personally. Identify [Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator) and use them to verify success.

If they love it, keep going! Add a link to favoriting that doesn't work. Track clicks. If enough people are trying to favorite, build it. Invite users in for an interview. Get their email and reach out personally.

If you try several different feature sets and find out that nobody wants a dating site for dogs, it's ok. In fact, that's great. That means you really did it. You tested the market cheaply _before_ you sunk bags of money into building Doggie Dates. That's a win.

An MVP is an _experimental process_, not a product development process. It's a small vision, tested and validated thoroughly before moving forward.

It's not twelve weeks of development and a release.
It's continuous deployment.
It's [not a buggy alpha site](http://vincentjordan.com/2012/01/why-is-your-minimal-viable-product-mvp-really-just-a-pos/) with ten features that _kind of_ work.
It's two features that work and look great.
It's bare, not broken.

On the other hand, an MVP approach is [not just _release early, release often_](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html), either. Yes, build a small thing. Yes, gather feedback and incorporate it. But don't let the feedback cause you to pivot so hard that you can't remember what you were trying to do in the first place. If you find yourself testing Amazon for dog toys instead of a dating site for dogs, you've lost your way.

Start with a vision and stay true to it. Build the skeleton, and let feedback from early users help you flesh out the details.

## Really MVP

So you want to build a thing, huh? You're going to change the world, like Steve Jobs? Slow down there, buckaroo! I hope you know what you're getting into.

According to [this article](http://get2growth.com/how-many-startups/), there were 1.35 million tech startups as of February 2014. Before you start dreaming of all that VC cash and crack your wallet open to get things off the ground, why don't you do a little experiment to see if it's at all likely that you'll end up anywhere besides broke.

### First Steps

You need to take a small first step.

What's the littlest thing you can build?

#### Landing Page

The classic example of an MVP is to put up a pixel-perfect landing page, touting all the benefits of joining Doggie Dates and driving users to sign up with their email for early access. You can drop Google Analytics into the page to track clicks and pageviews, and if anyone signs up too, great! You can reach out and ask them questions.


#### Email

#### Blog Post

#### Video

#### The Hustle

- Landing page
  Is a landing page an MVP?
  [nope](http://ramlijohn.com/a-landing-page-is-not-a-minimum-viable-product/)
  [yup](https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51)
  [yup](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html)
  If they sign up they're down for what you're selling (but is that clear enough to move forward?)
  It's for learning - use them emails to learn
- Email
- Blog
- Video
- Hustle

Google adwords
Offer to buy (Wizard of Oz)
Analytics

### Choosing Features

Can somebody use it?

Platform
Analytics

### Cycle

Release, Advertise, Analyze, Iterate
Build, Measure, Learn

Charge without building it
Deploy first, code later

## For CEOs + CTOs

1. Build one feature (start with email form)
2. Track clicks
3. If favorable,
     Customer Interview
     Goto #4
   Else
     Delete it
     Goto #1
4. Improve what you built
5. Goto #1

## For Consultants

Often already believe in the market
How can we adopt the lessons anyway

You need the release bar
Checkpoints
Every couple of weeks
Full slice - e.g. CMS and front end for ONE PAGE

What goes above, what goes below

## For Product Owners (New Features)

Make a link touting the new feature
It's not actually there
Track the clicks
If they want it, build it
Use the CEO/CTO cycle above
