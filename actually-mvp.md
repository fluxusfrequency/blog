# Actually MVP

## Introduction

## History

Steve Blank (SB) - _Four Steps to the Epiphany_ & customer development methodology
Eric Reis (ER) - 2008 [blog post](http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html)
Lean manufacturing + Kanban board, Taiichi Ohno

We've lost sight of it
Did you actually do a customer interview at any point

## Why MVP

Don't build stuff customers don't want
Accelerate learning
Reduce engineering time
Test a hypothesis with minimal resources
Might even mean not building software

## It's Not What You Think It Is

Minimum feature set (SB)
Just enough to deploy & be used
"A Minimum Viable Product is version of  your “product” that maximizes validated learning for the least amount of effort." (ER)
(Modern version - just enough to make them love it)
Lean on early adopters ("visionaries, not everyone" - SB)
Iterate
Its ok if nobody wants it -- that means you really did it
After several iterations with no takers, _then_ give up (and try something else)
It's an experimental process, not a product dev process

12 weeks of dev then release != MVP
Email form, prototype, subset, or full product

KPIs and continuous deployment
"Validated learning" (customer feedback)

It's not a buggy alpha POS
Not proof of concept
Bare, not broken. Two working features not eight broken ones

On the other hand,
It's not _release early, release often_
Leads to chasing your tail incorporating customer feedback (ER)
You should be creating the skeleton of where you're going, the early
  adpoters will fill in the blanks
Stays true to its vision while incorporating feedback

Gotta sell them, the narrative is key (feel like they're part of something)

### Really MVP

#### First Steps
- Landing page
  Is a landing page an MVP?
  [nope](http://ramlijohn.com/a-landing-page-is-not-a-minimum-viable-product/)
  [yup](https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51)
  If they sign up they're down for what you're selling (but is that clear enough to move forward?)
  It's for learning - use them emails to learn
- Email
- Blog
- Video
- Hustle

Google adwords
Offer to buy (Wizard of Oz)
Analytics

### Choosing Features

Can somebody use it?

Platform
Analytics

### Cycle

Release, Advertise, Analyze, Iterate
Build, Measure, Learn

Charge without building it
Deploy first, code later

## For CEOs + CTOs

1. Build one feature (start with email form)
2. Track clicks
3. If favorable,
     Customer Interview
     Goto #4
   Else
     Delete it
     Goto #1
4. Improve what you built
5. Goto #1

## For Consultants

Often already believe in the market
How can we adopt the lessons anyway

You need the release bar
Checkpoints
Every couple of weeks
Full slice - e.g. CMS and front end for ONE PAGE

What goes above, what goes below

## For Product Owners (New Features)

Make a link touting the new feature
It's not actually there
Track the clicks
If they want it, build it
Use the CEO/CTO cycle above
