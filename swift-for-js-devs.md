# Swift for JavaScript Developers

Stuff I learned:

- classes have an `init` function
- arguments are strongly typed
- class methods are `public`
- define an instance member before you initialize it
- declare function return types
- calculated properties on classes
- using closures (e.g. `with reduce`)
- var and let (immutable)
- no automatic type conversion (can't do || for truthy values)
- can't do `+=` on `int` and `int?`
