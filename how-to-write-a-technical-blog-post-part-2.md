# How To Write A Technical Blog Post
## Part 2: Write

In this three part series, we're looking at some of the best ways to get yourself into a good flow as a technical blogger. In the first part, we talked about some of the initial steps you can take when you're figuring out how to write a technical blog post. In this, the second part of of the series, we'll talk about how to do the actual writing itself: some effective structures you can use to organize your posts, the creative process of writing, and making sure that your content is as good as it can be.

## Define Your Structure

So you've got a topic, you've identified a long-tail keyword, and you're ready to start writing. You put your text editor in distraction-free mode, don your noise-canceling headphones, and get ready to dig in. But where to begin?

I recommend treating your first session on a given post as a scaffolding-building session. Don't expect to get into details. Forget about jokes and memes. Just sketch an outline of what you want to write about.

There are quite a few good ways to structure a blog post. But it needn't be overwhelming, and you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Just pick one of these basic approaches, and it should get you where you need to go.

### The List

You know what I'm talking about. Titles like [Five Ruby Methods You Should Be Using](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/five-ruby-methods-you-should-be-using) are gold. As readers, we know titles like this are a cheap shot, but we can't resist clicking anyway. That's why it's called click-bait.

If you're writing this kind of post, the structure is obvious: write an intro and a conclusion, and slap the five Ruby methods and their explanations in the middle.

### The How-To

So much of our industry is about learning new technologies and new ways to do things. Developers need to know "how to do X". When they google for it, perhaps your post will be the one they find. I used this structure in my [Wrapping Your API In A Ruby Gem](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/wrapping-your-api-in-a-ruby-gem) post.

Writing a how-to article is a little more complex than doing a list. I usually break it down like this:

```
1. Introduction
2. Introduce a theoretical coding situation
3. Write the test for what you want to solve
4. Make the test pass
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the point is made
6. Conclusion that includes a link to the code on GitHub
```

### The Five-paragraph Essay

If you're writing an opinion or agile process piece, the basic [Five-paragraph essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-paragraph_essay) style is a great way to organize your thoughts. Think about how you'll introduce your topic, develop it, and wrap it up. Your outline will look something like this:

```
1. Introduction & Thesis
2. Supporting Point 1
3. Supporting Point 2
4. Supporting Point 3
5. Conclusion
```

### The Well-Actually

At Quick Left, we do a lot of joking about [being a neckbeard](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard). There are a lot of smart people that work here, and they often have strong opinions. Sometimes when one person beings to make a statement, another will correct them with a sentence that begins with "well actually..."

"Well actually" is a great phrase, full of tension. In fact, you can build an entire blog post around it. Some of the most interesting articles I read are ones that follow what my mentor [Jeff Casimir]() called "the hero's journey".

The basic breakdown of the hero's journey story goes like this. First, you write about "I always thought that _foo_ worked like _bar_", or "I've always solved _foo_ by doing _bar_". Then you move on to say, "one day, I decided to solve _foo_ by using _baz_ instead". Finally, you wrap the whole thing up with "but it turns out that the correct solution is neither _bar_ nor _baz_, but _qux_". This is your "well actually moment". These kinds of posts can be fascinating to read because they follow a story arc, and there's more suspense than you get in flat structures like lists and how-tos.

## Interlude: Let It Simmer

Deciding on a topic, generating a long-tail keyword, and sketching out your basic structure is pretty good for a first day's work on a post. At this point, I usually like to leave the post alone for a while, to let it simmer in my subconscious. I've found that when I take a break and give it a little space, I usually come back with plenty of ideas of what to say. I find the resulting post a lot richer than when I force my way through all in one sitting.

## Fill In The Details

After you've taken a bit of a break, and you're ready to come back to your writing, it's time to actually do the hard part. This is usually when I want to do anything but sit down at the keyboard. I can think of a million distractions: "I'll start writing right after I go get a pumpkin spice latte", "Just as soon as I send this email", "I think I'll check Reddit first". All of these impulses are what a musical mentor of mine called _anything to avoid buckling down_.

So how do we overcome _anything to avoid buckling down_? My favorite way to deal with this problem is to set up a ritual. I won't get into the details of what mine entails, but here are some things that can be helpful: put on a specific kind of music, remove social media, email, and chat distractions, set up a different mode in your text editor, drink a certain coffee beverage. You can get even more superstitious if you want to. But the basic idea is that by identifying a series of things you do before you write, you can train your brain to get "in the zone".

Once you've gotten in the zone, how ever it is that you do that, just start writing. In part one, we generated our idea in a sudden flash of insight. You know the phrase "genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration"? This step - filling in the details - is the perspiration part.

The key thing at this stage is to let yourself get into flow state. Ideas will come up, and you will be tempted to stop and think "is that good enough", "is that really accurate", or "could I have worded that better"? I recommend just letting it come as it will, and put off the judgements for later. Interrupting yourself to evaluate your writing disrupts your flow. If you're a programmer, think of it as a TDD exercise: first make the test pass, _then_ refactor.

Often times, you'll have to repeat this process a couple of times before you get through your entire structure and have a complete first draft. Each time you sit down to write about it, you have to get back into the flow. Just follow your ritual and keep working, and you'll be through it before you know it.

## Write A Conclusion

There's kind of a fine art to writing a conclusion section. On the one hand, you want to reiterate and summarize the high-level concepts (or steps) to what you've been talking about. On the other, you want to encourage the reader to think about the wider implications of the subject. How can it be applied to other situations? How can what you've been talking about be extended illuminate a higher level of understanding?

The conclusion is also a great place to encourage people to take some sort of action on what they've learned. Whoever's hosting your blog post would probably like to have the readers interact with their website. You can push them to do this by linking them to relevant content elsewhere in the site. Or you can use a P.S. section encouraging them to leave a comment on your post.

## Proofread It (Twice)

Once you've completed your conclusion, your first draft is done. Take another break and get some space from the post. Shift your mindset from "getting stuff done" to "let's clean this up" instead.

Remember above when I suggested you put off judging or evaluating your work? Now's the time. It's time for everyone's least favorite part of writing: proofreading. You need to do it. Read through it and make changes. Then read through it aloud and see how it sounds. Make more changes. Pretend that you are a member of your target audience and read it from their point of view.

The more times you repeat this process, the more clear and understandable your writing will be. Aim for brevity and precision. Only write as much as you need to to get your point across, cutting out extraneous words and explanations and really tightening up your word choices.

## Ask For Review

It's a really good idea to get another set of eyes on your writing. If you're lucky enough to have an editor, they will give you lots of great ideas for phrasing, word choice, and structure. If not, reach out to your peers to see if any of them are willing to help you improve your work. Especially target those you think already know the ins and outs how to write a technical blog post. The more people you can get to check your work before you release it to the world, the better.

You can also check with someone in the role you're writing for. If there's nobody on your team in that role, you can also try reaching out to a popular influencer in that role on Twitter or elsewhere on the web. In fact, this is also a good thing to consider doing for promotional purposes. Reaching out to major influencers early and gathering their feedback on your topic might lead to them sharing your content, which will greatly improve your traffic.

At any rate, take your reviewers' advice to heart. That doesn't mean you have to make every single change they suggest. At the same time, try to keep in mind that they're not out to criticize your writing. They're trying to help you, and the way that they understand your words is probably a good indicator of where you could improve the way you're explaining things.

Once you think you're done proofreading, editing, and making changes from reviewer comments, you're almost done writing. But first, there's just one more thing. Proofread it again. I'm not kidding.

## Wrapping Up

Even if you know what you want to write about, the process of actually getting the words down can be hard if you haven't done a lot of bloggin in the past. In this post, we've looked at some cookie-cutter structures you can use to scaffold your post, the importance of giving yourself some space between writing sessions, and tips for proofreading.
