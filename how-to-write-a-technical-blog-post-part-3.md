# How To Write A Technical Blog Post
## Part 3: Publish

In this three part series, we're exploring what it takes to break into the technical blogging space. In the first part, we looked at initial steps you can take to get into a good writing flow. In the second part, we explored how to do the actual writing itself. In this, the third and final part of this series, we'll talk about one more aspect of how to write a technical blog post: getting as many people to read it as possible.

## Survey Your Kingdom

At this point, you've generated your blog post idea, thought about your long-tail keyword, written and edited your blog post. Now it's time to think about pushing your little bird out of the nest and seeing how she flies.

First, take another look at what you've written. Is there anything you left out? Are there parts you've included that don't really belong? Maybe you can split them out and use them for another post. Your readers will probably appreciate it if you stick to a single topic. It makes for an easier time digesting what you're talking about.

Along the same lines, take a look at the length of your post. If it's really long, consider splitting it into a series. I've found that the best length is around 750-1000 words. After that, posts tend to lose focus, and readers tend to check out.

When you're sure that you've got your post(s) tightly focused, you're almost ready to publish.

## Optimize for SEO

Since you want to get as much traffic as you can once your post goes live, this is a good time to go through your post and make sure that you're [optimized for SEO](https://moz.com/blog/visual-guide-to-keyword-targeting-onpage-optimization).

Here are some things to consider. Is your keyword phrase in all of the following places? The page title, main headline, repeated a couple of times in the body, meta description and the page URL? It's also a good idea to include several images (don't forget the `alt` tags!), links to pages internal and external to your site, and a set of relevant meta keywords. For fun, you can also view your page as it appears to a search engine bot using the [SEO Browser](http://seo-browser.com/).

## Build The Buzz

Ok. Your content is all set. All that's left is to send it out into the world. Think about how you're going to do it. A blog post is not like a software product. A soft launch is usually not a great idea.

When I'm thinking about releasing a post, I think back to my days in the music industry. There's some common wisdom in that world about releasing an album. Basically, you want to build the buzz like a swelling wave in the weeks before the album drops. Then, you drop it right when the wave is at its peak. The number of sales you make in the first week is greatly indicative of how well the album will sell over time.

While this may not be exactly true for tech blog posts, as they can stay relevant or even become _more_ relevant as the industry changes, I think it's still worth thinking about this idea of the wave swell when getting ready to publish a post. Good ways to build the buzz are to reach out to influencers before you publish, talk about the topic (and related topics) on Twitter and Hacker News, and piggyback on trending hashtags to get people thinking about your topic.

Ideally, by the time you go live, you'll just be continuing the conversation that's already been happening.

## Schedule Release

Going along with the idea of building the buzz, be intentional about when you plan to publish your post. You can configure your blog platform to make the post go public at a specific time. You can also schedule your media promotions.

Find out the times when your target readers are most likely to see that your article came out, and [publish then](http://www.shortstack.com/the-best-times-to-post-on-social-media-infographic/).

If you know there's an event related to your post coming up, plan to publish just before or after that event. For example, you're writing about a new feature in Rails 5 feature and it's coming out on Christmas, plan to publish your post on December 22nd or 27th.

If you're a prolific writer, you can space out your posts to build on your own buzz. If you have two posts ready to go, don't publish them a day apart. Give the first one a little time to get some traction, then hit your audience with the second just as they're beginning to forget about you.

Spending a little time thinking about when you should publish you post can go a long way toward getting your voice heard.

## Shout It From The Rooftops

This final point is probably obvious, but you'll want to promote your work as much as you can around the web once it finally goes live. Here are some good places to self-promote.

Minimum: Twitter, HN, Reddit as soon as it comes out.

- Twitter
- Hacker News
- Lobste.rs
- Reddit
- Quora
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Stack Exchange
- Slack Communities
- Coworking space forums
- Smashing Magazine
- Medium
- Pointer.io
- Paper.li

If your blog allows comments, or if you post to Hacker News or Reddit, you'll probably begin to get some questions and hear some opinions. Take the time to respond to them. The most you engage with people, the better off you are.

## Wrapping Up

Over the course of this three part series, we've followed the entire cycle of how to write a technical blog post. Starting from the barren field of your mind with nothing but doubts in part one, and we traveled through the process of how to actually _write posts_ in part two. With this post, part three, we've come all the way to SEO optimization and promoting yourself in the blogosphere.

I hope this survey has given you the tools you need to enter the world of technical blogging. Although it can seem overwhelming at first, it's actually not as difficult as it seems. Once you've written a post or two, you begin to establish a flow. And, people start to recognize you around the web (and around town). The cache you've earned at that point only makes it easier to be sure that you'll be taken seriously with each new post you publish.

Best of luck to you in your writing career. I look forward to reading what you come up with!
