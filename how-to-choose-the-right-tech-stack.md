# How to Choose the Right Tech Stack for Your App

Whether you're bootstrapping a startup or you're the overseer of a tech empire, there comes a time when you have to make tough decision. You're getting ready to build (or rebuild) a new application that will be vital to your company's continued success. What tools should you use?

As consultants, clients ask my coworkers and I at Quick Left to help them make this decision on a regular basis. We've worked in a wide array of languages and frameworks, and worked alongside many businesses as they found their way to success. When deciding on which tech stack to use, using the wrong technology can set you back by weeks or months. On the other hand, placing a good bet makes growth easier.

There are a lot of things to consider in making this choice, but in this post I'll walk you some of the things I usually consider when making a recommendation. So if you asked me how to choose the right tech stack for your app, what would I say? Read on to find out!

## Some Basic Things to Consider

Some of the first questions to ask yourself when evaluating a tech stack are the same ones you would think about when thinking about your [User Experience](https://quickleft.com/blog/ux-is-not-just-ui/). Before you even make a list of the choices available to you, you'll want to decide what _kind_ of app you're building.

Who is you user base? What is their demographic? Are they young? Old? Urban? Rural? Comfortable with technology? More importantly, do you expect them to access your application from their mobile device, desktop computer, or something else? Knowing whether you need a mobile or web application, or both, will narrow down your choices quite a bit.

Another consideration is whether you are making something very similar to an existing application, riffing off a known paradigm, or building something never seen before. If your customers are used to a native mobile experience, you will probably want to match it by choosing a native technology as well. If you're trying to bring a desktop-style experience to the web, you'll probably be looking at a single page app.

Finally, you should think about your timeline. Do you need to get to market as fast as possible, or do you have time to build something with a little more lasting power? Some technologies are great for getting an application out the door as quickly as possible. Others are great at solving certain problems like scalability and performance, but will take a little longer to build.

Answering these basic questions will help narrow down the technologies you need to look at. Now that you've thought about what kind of application you want to build, I recommend that you consider what kind of company it's being built for.

## What Stage is Your Company?

The tech field is home to companies of all shapes and sizes, from two guys in a basement to global corporations with hundreds of divisions. Where do you fall in the spectrum? The answer to that question has huge implications. It will shape how you structure your budget, what you do to try to draw new customers, how you present your brand, among other things.

When it comes to choosing the right tech stack for your app, the size and positioning of your company is also of great importance. Let's take a look at some of the implications for companies of a few different sizes.

### Basement Bootstrappers

You've got a great idea and you're sure it's going to make you bags of cash. Maybe this is your first rodeo, or maybe you've done this before. But either way, your goal is clear: get it built, and get it in front of people so that you can prove your concept.

For tech companies in this early stage, it's vital that adding features is cheap and quick. You're almost certainly following an [MVP process](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/actually-mvp), which means you're going to be throwing a lot of things out.

If you know your code is going to be disposable, you'll want to use the easiest tool you can find. Some good choices might include [WordPress](), basic PHP, or just a static site generated with [Jekyll]() or [HarpJS](). All of these technologies are easily understood, and you can probably get started with them yourself even if you're not especially technical.

In some cases, you might already know that you need to build something that will last a little while. If you've already proven your concept in a basic way, and need to build something that you can add on to easily, but you're still very young, you might want to consider using [Ruby on Rails]() or [Django]() with server-rendered pages. Both frameworks are easy to build new features in, and have the added bonus of being well-known, so you will find it easier to hire new developers to work on your code as you continue to grow.

### Proven Market

Building a platform that can scale
Avoiding YAGNI and premature optimization
Creating something that will last

### Newly Established and Growing

Scaling your app under load
Paying off tech debt
Adding whole new arms to the business easily
Architecture

### Well-Established

Serving large numbers of customers
Many parts of the app might be serving double-duty, e.g. Auth => some will split out microservices here
Slow moving unless you can pay off tech debt and do upgrades in a reasonable way
Architecture


## Choosing a Technology

My colleague Laura Steadman's article on [Evaluating Open Source Libraries](https://quickleft.com/blog/evaluating-open-source-libraries-five-questions-to-ask/).

- Is it well-documented?
- Is there an active community around it?
- Will you be able to hire more devs to work on it easily if it blows up?
- JS Frameworks - rate of change, who's supporting
- Build tools - babel, grunt, etc
- Testing
- Databases - Postgres
- DevOps - how much support do you need vs. what resources do you have available?
- External services - analytics, push notifications, etc.
- Need that one weird trick?
