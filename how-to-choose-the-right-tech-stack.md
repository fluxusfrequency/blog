# How to Choose the Right Tech Stack for Your App

## Choices to be Made

- Mobile, Web, Both, or Hybrid?
- Are you MVPing? Consider WordPress
- Single Page App / JS-heavy OR server-rendered pages?
- Which Framework?


## What Stage is Your Company?

### Brand New - MVP

Cheap and quick to market
WordPress
Rails with server-rendered pages
You might throw it out

### Proven Market

Building a platform that can scale
Avoiding YAGNI and premature optimization
Creating something that will last

### Newly Established and Growing

Scaling your app under load
Paying off tech debt
Adding whole new arms to the business easily
Architecture

### Well-Established

Serving large numbers of customers
Many parts of the app might be serving double-duty, e.g. Auth => some will split out microservices here
Slow moving unless you can pay off tech debt and do upgrades in a reasonable way
Architecture


## Choosing a Technology

- Is it well-documented?
- Is there an active community around it?
- Will you be able to hire more devs to work on it easily if it blows up?
- JS Frameworks - rate of change, who's supporting
- Build tools - babel, grunt, etc
- Testing
- Databases - Postgres
- DevOps - how much support do you need vs. what resources do you have available?
- External services - analytics, push notifications, etc.
