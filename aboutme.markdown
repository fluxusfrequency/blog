Hi, my name is Ben Lewis. I'm live in Denver, CO, and practice software development as a craft. I mainly program in JavaScript and Ruby, with a splash of Scala. My technologies of choice include Rails, Sinatra, Backbone.js, Express.js, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. My strengths include: test driven development, software architecture design, solving complex problems, and collaboration. I find programming software fascinating; I love learning new technologies and code patterns. I am particularly interested in TDD, Single Page Applications, security, and pairing.

Currently, I'm a student at a technology bootcamp called gSchool, taught by Jeff Casimir, Katrina Owen, and Franklin Webber of [Jumpstart Lab](http://jumpstartlab.com/). Over the course of 24 weeks, my classmates and I are learning full stack development, using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Rails, Sinatra, Ruby, Git, SQL, and Unix. We're also working on our soft skills, learning Pivotal Tracker, agile development, and best practices for pairing. Here are some of [the books](http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2013/12/01/what-ive-been-reading/) I've been reading.

Although I'm a third generation programmer, my background is in music education. I hold a B.A. in Music from Vassar College, and I'm an active bluegrass fiddle performer in Colorado. Before coming to the software world, I was an elementary school music teacher. I taught music to K-5 students using iPads, ProTools, GarageBand, Zimbabwean marimba orchestra, and ukuleles. I also created a world music concert series and multiple after-school programs at the schools where I taught.

When I finish gSchool in February 2014, I will be looking for a job as a developer. I'm seeking a position where value is placed on the craft of programming via pairing, TDD, and a dedication to continuous learning. I want to collaborate creatively with colleagues to build elegant solutions to difficult problems.
