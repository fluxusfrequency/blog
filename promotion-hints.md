# Hints to promote your post
- Share through other slack communities
- Share on your own social networks
- Post on publishing sites specific to the topic
- Submit to larger publishing sites like Smashing Magazine, Inc, Forbes and more.
- Work with marketing to understand the "person" you're writing your piece for and promote where they spend their time online
- Coworking space forums and other online forums
- Share your content multiple times
- Use images and tag those images appropriately
- Use longtail keywords phrases at least 3 times in your post and the keyword in your title
- Do google poetry! If you think you have a problem identified for the person you are writing, start googling to see what popular questions are coming up. If it doesn't come up, then that might be a good start or if the question you do type up does come up but no good articles written about it, this is also a good place to start
- Use google.com/trends to see what words/phrases are trending right now
- Ask your clients what problems they are facing
- Listen in standup for cool solutions and problems you're solving. Tons of good content there.
- Link to other people's posts and tag them on twitter when you promote it
- Include a CTA
- Top 6 words for titles: How, Your, What, Best, Why, Tip (in that order)
