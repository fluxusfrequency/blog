# How To Write A Technical Blog Post

Content is king. Bill Gates [predicted it in 1996](http://www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/). Much of the money made online today is in content. In the tech world, where languages and frameworks are here today and gone tomorrow, this is doubly true. Developers, managers, and CEOs of technical companies spend an enormous amount of time understanding their chosen tools, the next hot thing, and how to stay relevant. It's no wonder so many startups host blogs on their sites. Blogs drive traffic to your site, increase your visibility, and elevate your brand in the tech world. So how can you get a piece of the action? Read on to find out!

## Step 1. Prepare

### Get Psyched Up

Setting out to write a blog post can be overwhelming. Many people find it hard to choose a topic. I think a lot of this comes down to feeling like you don't know enough about anything to write about it. But if you think that you have to be an expert before you start writing, think again. I don't know how many times I've heard people say: "I would write about _(insert technology)_ if I knew a little bit more about it". It's common to feel uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a piece telling the world "how you should do _X_". But fret not. This is just a little bit of [imposter syndrome](http://startupbros.com/21-ways-overcome-impostor-syndrome/).

```
If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.

- Yogi Bhajan
```

Try on a different perspective: think of blogging as a learning process. Maybe you're not the world's foremost expert on [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but it interests you. It's a little bit hard to wrap your head around. Instead of feeling like you have to be an experienced Flux developer before write about it, think of it as the path you'll use to understand it. There's no better way to understand something deeply than to teach it.

Blogging can be a great way to structure what you want to understand about a topic and how you will get there. What are the components of the topic? How can you break it down? What little pieces can you try to grok that will help you see the big picture? These are the questions you have to ask when you're teaching something. They also happen to be the questions you'll need to answer to learn something!

You can also use it as a way to document "how you do Flux" for later. That way, once you've gone through the struggle of figuring out what's going on, you'll have a handy place to go back to and remind yourself what you did - in your own writing!

There have been a number of times in [my blogging career](http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/archives/) when people have read one of my posts, then reached out to me and and asked: "you're an expert on _X_, what can you tell me about this one arcane part of how its written?" In almost every case, it was the first time I'd even tried to understand the topic!

### Brainstorm

Once you've gotten past your initial reservations about writing, it's time to choose a topic. Figuring out what to write about can be daunting, but once you know where to look, you find that fertile ideas present themselves every day.

Here are a few of the strategies I use to come up with topic ideas.

As a consultant, I work on a lot of different projects. Each one usually has one or two unusual problems that have to be solved, either due to the business domain or idiosyncracies of the tech stack. I keep an eye out for [things like this](http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/12/09/caching-asynchronous-queries-in-backbone/) and write about them. The usually make for an interesting read for curious developers.

I also keep an eye out for ways that I am percieved to stand out by client dev teams. Sometimes, I will suggest a certain way of doing things that is new to a team, and I get a lot of feedback about what a great idea it is. For example, the [Quick Left Pull Request Template](https://quickleft.com/blog/pull-request-templates-make-code-review-easier/) is often quite appreciated.

Similarly, the particular business situation that a client company finds itself often lends itself to a process post. I recently did some work for a company whose code base hadn't been worked on for a while, so I wrote [this post](https://quickleft.com/blog/ramping-up-developers-on-code/) to help technical leaders in this situation find some direction.

In all of these examples, you could just as easily leverage your business or technical situation even if you're not a consultant.

If you've thought about all of the things you've been facing lately and you're still drawing a blank, you can always go the old fashioned route: Google it. Sites like [Buzzsumo](http://buzzsumo.com/), [SEMRush](http://www.semrush.com/), and [Alexa](http://www.alexa.com/) are great for generating ideas. I also recommend [Google Trends](https://www.google.com/trends/) for figuring out what's hot. All of these tools are great ways to identify things to write about that people will actually be interested in reading, which will be great for generating page views.

### Consider Your Audience

While we're on the topic of page views, you should probably consider who it is that you're writing for. Is it developers? Your product owner, scrum coach, or CEO? Maybe marketers or salespeople? What role do they play in the tech industry?

It's vital to have an idea of who you want to read your post. Knowing this enables you to ask two important questions.

The first is: "what problem(s) does this person need to solve in order to do his/her job?" When people face a difficulty they don't know how to solve, they google the answer. If your blog post comes up at the top of the search results, they'll probably read it.

On the other hand, some folks will look for the answers to their questions in other places online. Where does your target audience spend their time? Are they hanging out on Reddit, Stack Exchange, or Quora? Think about how you can get your post there, and write it such that it will fit into that online community.

### Identify A Long-Tail Keyword

You might think that marketing your piece is something that comes after you've written it. But considering how you will promote your piece before you write it. One of the easiest wins you can make early on is to [choose an effective title](http://www.8womendream.com/about-the-women-of-8-women-dream/author-catherine-hughes/award-winning-titles-and-headlines-for-inspiration-to-create-viral-blog-posts).

I typically try to match my titles with a well-chosen [long tail keyword](http://www.wordtracker.com/academy/keyword-research/technical-guides/three-good-reasons-to-target-long-tail-keywords). Long tail keywords are specifically targeted 3-4 word phrases meant to be found by readers researching a particular topic.

Because single-word rankings in search results are very competitive, it's easier to get a high rank for a multi-word phrase than a single keyword for a given search. Usually, it's best to think of the most compact way to express what you're writing about using common language. For example, the long-tail keyword for _this_ post is "How to write a technical blog". It's a little long, but it's more likely that someone would search for that than "Steps to follow when you want to publish your first technical blog post". On the other side, it's more likely that my audience will find my post than if I had used something more generic like "tech blogging".

Generating a good long-tail keyword is a bit of a fine art. If you have any friends that are marketers, ask them for help. Barring that, you can google terms similar to your idea to see what people are asking about, use a thesaurus, or follow the suggestions in [this article](http://blog.hubspot.com/insiders/find-keywords-for-your-business).

## Step 2. Write

### Define Your Structure

So you've got a topic, you've identified a long-tail keyword, and you're ready to start writing. You put your text editor in distraction-free mode, don your noise-canceling headphones, and get ready to dig in. But where to begin?

I recommend treating your first session on a given post as a scaffolding-building session. Don't expect to get into details. Forget about jokes and memes. Just sketch an outline of what you want to write about.

There are quite a few good ways to structure a blog post. But it needn't be overwhelming, and you don't have to reinvent the wheel. Just pick one of these basic approaches, and it should get you where you need to go.

#### The List

You know what I'm talking about. Titles like [Five Ruby Methods You Should Be Using](https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/five-ruby-methods-you-should-be-using) are gold. As readers, we know titles like this are a cheap shot, but we can't resist clicking anyway. That's why it's called click-bait.

If you're writing this kind of post, the structure is obvious: write an intro and a conclusion, and slap the five Ruby methods and their explanations in the middle.

#### The How-To

So much of our industry is about learning new technologies and new ways to do things. Developers need to know "how to do X". When they google for it, perhaps your post will be the one they find. I used this structure in my [Wrapping Your API In A Ruby Gem](https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/wrapping-your-api-in-a-ruby-gem) post.

Writing a how-to article is a little more complex than doing a list. I usually break it down like this:

```
1. Introduction
2. Introduce a theoretical coding situation
3. Write the test for what you want to solve
4. Make the test pass
5. Repeat steps 3-4 until the point is made
6. Conclusion that includes a link to the code on GitHub
```

#### The Five-paragraph Essay

If you're writing an opinion or agile process piece, the basic [Five-paragraph essay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five-paragraph_essay) style is a great way to organize your thoughts. Think about how you'll introduce your topic, develop it, and wrap it up. Your outline will look something like this:

```
1. Introduction & Thesis
2. Supporting Point 1
3. Supporting Point 2
4. Supporting Point 3
5. Conclusion
```

#### The Well-Actually

At Quick Left, we do a lot of joking about [being a neckbeard](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=neckbeard). There are a lot of smart people that work here, and they often have strong opinions. Sometimes when one person beings to make a statement, another will correct them with a sentence that begins with "well actually..."

"Well actually" is a great phrase, full of tension. In fact, you can build an entire blog post around it. Some of the most interesting articles I read are ones that follow what my mentor [Jeff Casimir]() called "the hero's journey".

The basic breakdown of the hero's journey story goes like this. First, you write about "I always thought that _foo_ worked like _bar_", or "I've always solved _foo_ by doing _bar_". Then you move on to say, "one day, I decided to solve _foo_ by using _baz_ instead". Finally, you wrap the whole thing up with "but it turns out that the correct solution is neither _bar_ nor _baz_, but _qux_". This is your "well actually moment". These kinds of posts can be fascinating to read because they follow a story arc, and there's more suspense than you get in flat structures like lists and how-tos.

### Interlude: Let It Simmer

Deciding on a topic, generating a long-tail keyword, and sketching out your basic structure is pretty good for a first day's work on a post. At this point, I usually like to leave the post alone for a while, to let it simmer in my subconscious. I've found that when I take a break and give it a little space, I usually come back with plenty of ideas of what to say. I find the resulting post a lot richer than when I force my way through all in one sitting.

### Fill In The Details

After you've taken a bit of a break, and you're ready to come back to your writing, it's time to actually do the hard part. This is usually when I want to do anything but sit down at the keyboard. I can think of a million distractions: "I'll start writing right after I go get a pumpkin spice latte", "Just as soon as I send this email", "I think I'll check Reddit first". All of these impulses are what a musical mentor of mine called _anything to avoid buckling down_.

So how do we overcome _anything to avoid buckling down_? My favorite way to deal with this problem is to set up a ritual. I won't get into the details of what mine entails, but here are some things that can be helpful: put on a specific kind of music, remove social media, email, and chat distractions, set up a different mode in your text editor, drink a certain coffee beverage. You can get even more superstitious if you want to. But the basic idea is that by identifying a series of things you do before you write, you can train your brain to get "in the zone".

Once you've gotten in the zone, how ever it is that you do that, just start writing. In part one, we generated our idea in a sudden flash of insight. You know the phrase "genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration"? This step - filling in the details - is the perspiration part.

The key thing at this stage is to let yourself get into flow state. Ideas will come up, and you will be tempted to stop and think "is that good enough", "is that really accurate", or "could I have worded that better"? I recommend just letting it come as it will, and put off the judgements for later. Interrupting yourself to evaluate your writing disrupts your flow. If you're a programmer, think of it as a TDD exercise: first make the test pass, _then_ refactor.

Often times, you'll have to repeat this process a couple of times before you get through your entire structure and have a complete first draft. Each time you sit down to write about it, you have to get back into the flow. Just follow your ritual and keep working, and you'll be through it before you know it.

### Write A Conclusion

There's kind of a fine art to writing a conclusion section. On the one hand, you want to reiterate and summarize the high-level concepts (or steps) to what you've been talking about. On the other, you want to encourage the reader to think about the wider implications of the subject. How can it be applied to other situations? How can what you've been talking about be extended illuminate a higher level of understanding?

The conclusion is also a great place to encourage people to take some sort of action on what they've learned. Whoever's hosting your blog post would probably like to have the readers interact with their website. You can push them to do this by linking them to relevant content elsewhere in the site. Or you can use a P.S. section encouraging them to leave a comment on your post.

### Proofread It (Twice)

Once you've completed your conclusion, your first draft is done. Take another break and get some space from the post. Shift your mindset from "getting stuff done" to "let's clean this up" instead.

Remember above when I suggested you put off judging or evaluating your work? Now's the time. It's time for everyone's least favorite part of writing: proofreading. You need to do it. Read through it and make changes. Then read through it aloud and see how it sounds. Make more changes. Pretend that you are a member of your target audience and read it from their point of view.

The more times you repeat this process, the more clear and understandable your writing will be. Aim for brevity and precision. Only write as much as you need to to get your point across, cutting out extraneous words and explanations and really tightening up your word choices.

### Ask For Review

It's a really good idea to get another set of eyes on your writing. If you're lucky enough to have an editor, they will give you lots of great ideas for phrasing, word choice, and structure. If not, reach out to your peers to see if any of them are willing to help you improve your work. The more people you can get to check your work before you release it to the world, the better.

You can also check with someone in the role you're writing for. If there's nobody on your team in that role, you can also try reaching out to a popular influencer in that role on Twitter or elsewhere on the web. In fact, this is also a good thing to consider doing for promotional purposes. Reaching out to major influencers early and gathering their feedback on your topic might lead to them sharing your content, which will greatly improve your traffic.

At any rate, take your reviewers' advice to heart. That doesn't mean you have to make every single change they suggest. At the same time, try to keep in mind that they're not out to criticize your writing. They're trying to help you, and the way that they understand your words is probably a good indicator of where you could improve the way you're explaining things.

Once you think you're done proofreading, editing, and making changes from reviewer comments, you're almost done writing. But first, there's just one more thing. Proofread it again. I'm not kidding.

## Step 3. Publish

### Survey Your Kingdom

At this point, you've generated your blog post idea, thought about your long-tail keyword, written and edited your blog post. Now it's time to think about pushing your little bird out of the nest and seeing how she flies.

First, take another look at what you've written. Is there anything you left out? Are there parts you've included that don't really belong? Maybe you can split them out and use them for another post. Your readers will probably appreciate it if you stick to a single topic. It makes for an easier time digesting what you're talking about.

Along the same lines, take a look at the length of your post. If it's really long, consider splitting it into a series. I've found that the best length is around 750-1000 words. After that, posts tend to lose focus, and readers tend to check out.

When you're sure that you've got your post(s) tightly focused, you're almost ready to publish.

### Optimize for SEO

Since you want to get as much traffic as you can once your post goes live, this is a good time to go through your post and make sure that you're [optimized for SEO](https://moz.com/blog/visual-guide-to-keyword-targeting-onpage-optimization).

Here are some things to consider. Is your keyword phrase in all of the following places? The page title, main headline, repeated a couple of times in the body, meta description and the page URL? It's also a good idea to include several images (don't forget the `alt` tags!), links to pages internal and external to your site, and a set of relevant meta keywords. For fun, you can also view your page as it appears to a search engine bot using the [SEO Browser](http://seo-browser.com/).

### Build The Buzz

Ok. Your content is all set. All that's left is to send it out into the world. Think about how you're going to do it. A blog post is not like a software product. A soft launch is usually not a great idea.

When I'm thinking about releasing a post, I think back to my days in the music industry. There's some common wisdom in that world about releasing an album. Basically, you want to build the buzz like a swelling wave in the weeks before the album drops. Then, you drop it right when the wave is at its peak. The number of sales you make in the first week is greatly indicative of how well the album will sell over time.

While this may not be exactly true for tech blog posts, as they can stay relevant or even become _more_ relevant as the industry changes, I think it's still worth thinking about this idea of the wave swell when getting ready to publish a post. Good ways to build the buzz are to reach out to influencers before you publish, talk about the topic (and related topics) on Twitter and Hacker News, and piggyback on trending hashtags to get people thinking about your topic.

Ideally, by the time you go live, you'll just be continuing the conversation that's already been happening.

### Schedule Release

Going along with the idea of building the buzz, be intentional about when you plan to publish your post. You can configure your blog platform to make the post go public at a specific time. You can also schedule your media promotions.

Find out the times when your target readers are most likely to see that your article came out, and [publish then](http://www.shortstack.com/the-best-times-to-post-on-social-media-infographic/).

If you know there's an event related to your post coming up, plan to publish just before or after that event. For example, you're writing about a new feature in Rails 5 feature and it's coming out on Christmas, plan to publish your post on December 22nd or 27th.

If you're a prolific writer, you can space out your posts to build on your own buzz. If you have two posts ready to go, don't publish them a day apart. Give the first one a little time to get some traction, then hit your audience with the second just as they're beginning to forget about you.

Spending a little time thinking about when you should publish you post can go a long way toward getting your voice heard.

### Shout It From The Housetops

This final point is probably obvious, but you'll want to promote your work as much as you can around the web once it finally goes live. Here are some good places to self-promote.

Minimum: Twitter, HN, Reddit as soon as it comes out.

- Twitter
- Hacker News
- Lobste.rs
- Reddit
- Quora
- Facebook
- LinkedIn
- Stack Exchange
- Slack Communities
- Coworking space forums
- Smashing Magazine
- Medium
- Pointer.io
- Paper.li

If your blog allows comments, or if you post to Hacker News or Reddit, you'll probably begin to get some questions and hear some opinions. Take the time to respond to them. The most you engage with people, the better off you are.

## Conclusion

In this post, we've followed the entire cycle of how to write a technical blog post. Starting from the barren field of your mind with nothing but doubts, we've come all the way to promoting yourself in the blogosphere. Along the way, we touched on a myriad of topics, including how to generate ideas, how to plan for SEO from the get-go, finding a working process that lets you be productive, planning your release, and promoting your work online.

I hope that this survey has given you the tools you need to enter the world of blogging. Although it can seem overwhelming at first, it's actually not as difficult as it seems. Once you've written a post or two, people start to recognize you around the web (and maybe around town, too). The cache you've earned at that point only makes it easier to be sure that you'll be taken seriously with each new post you publish.

Best of luck to you in your writing career. I look forward to reading what you come up with!
