# How To Write A Technical Blog Post

Content is king. Bill Gates [predicted it in 1996](http://www.craigbailey.net/content-is-king-by-bill-gates/). Much of the money made online today is in content. In the tech world, where languages and frameworks are here today and gone tomorrow, this is doubly true. Developers, managers, and CEOs of technical companies spend an enormous amount of time understanding their chosen tools, the next hot thing, and how to stay relevant. It's no wonder so many startups host blogs on their sites. Blogs drive traffic to your site, increase your visibility, and elevate your brand in the tech world. So how can you get a piece of the action? Read on to find out!

## Step 1. Prepare

### Get Psyched Up

Setting out to write a blog post can be overwhelming. Many people find it hard to choose a topic. I think a lot of this comes down to feeling like you don't know enough about anything to write about it. But if you think that you have to be an expert before you start writing, think again. I don't know how many times I've heard people say: "I would write about _(insert technology)_ if I knew a little bit more about it". It's common to feel uncomfortable with the idea of publishing a piece telling the world "how you should do _X_". But fret not. This is just a little bit of [imposter syndrome](http://startupbros.com/21-ways-overcome-impostor-syndrome/).

If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.

Try on a different perspective: think of blogging as a learning process. Maybe you're not the world's foremost expert on [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/), but it interests you. It's a little bit hard to wrap your head around. Instead of feeling like you have to be an experienced Flux developer before write about it, think of it as the path you'll use to understand it. There's no better way to understand something deeply than to teach it.

Blogging can be a great way to structure what you want to understand about a topic and how you will get there. What are the components of the topic? How can you break it down? What little pieces can you try to grok that will help you see the big picture? These are the questions you have to ask when you're teaching something. They also happen to be the questions you'll need to answer to learn something!

You can also use it as a way to document "how you do Flux" for later. That way, once you've gone through the struggle of figuring out what's going on, you'll have a handy place to go back to and remind yourself what you did - in your own writing!

There have been a number of times in [my blogging career](http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/archives/) when people have read one of my posts, then reached out to me and and asked: "you're an expert on _X_, what can you tell me about this one arcane part of how its written?" In almost every case, it was the first time I'd even tried to understand the topic!

### Brainstorm

Once you've gotten past your initial reservations about writing, it's time to choose a topic. It can feel daunting to figure out what to write about, but once you know where to look, you find that fertile ideas present themselves every day.

Here are a few of the strategies I use to come up with topic ideas.

Use gotchas / weird hacks from a project you've been working on
If you're on team boost and something resonated with their team, write about that
Use business situations to generate process posts
Ask your client PO
Use Buzzsumo, SEMRush, Alexa to generate ideas
Google Trends

### Consider Your Audience

Where do they spend their time online
What problems do they need to solve to do their job

### Identify A Long-Tail Keyword

Google terms similar to your idea to see what people are asking
It's easier to get a high rank for a multi-word phrase than a single keyword

Use a Thesaurus

Basic 5 paragraph essay style
It seems like it's this, but really it's this, no wait it's actually _this_

Try not to judge yourself too much - that comes later
Dionysus and Apollo

### Write A Conclusion

Really. Do it. Read it out loud even.

Add more links and images
Split it into a series if its long (750-1500 words)
